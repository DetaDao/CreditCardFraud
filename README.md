# CreditCardFraud
This project focuses on Credit card fraud detection using Machine learning . Different algorithms were used but Logistic regression had the highest accuracy.
Due to imbalanced dataset, I simulated data to create a balance environment via the use of Imlearn.
The model that was created had an accuracy of 93%.

Further improvemnet will be introduced in future
